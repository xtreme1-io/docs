  Xtreme1 v0.6.0: Support Integrating User's Models and Data Import & Export
  Function Enhancement
---

# V 0.6.0

We are pleased to announce the release of Xtreme1 v0.6. After a couple of weeks of dedicated work, this update is now available for download.In this update, Xtreme1 provides users with the ability to integrate their own model. Additionally, the display effect of the similarity map has been improved.We understand that some users face challenges with data formats when uploading and exporting data. To solve this problem, we have updated our documentation which can be found at [https://docs.xtreme1.io/](https://docs.xtreme1.io/). We have also created a "universal" converter from xtreme1-sdk ([https://github.com/xtreme1-io/xtreme1-sdk](https://github.com/xtreme1-io/xtreme1-sdk)).&#x20;

## **New Features**

### Modal Integration

To give users more control over their own models, we have added functionality that allows them to create, edit, search, and delete models. With this feature, users can manage basic model information, classes, configuration details, and run the model on datasets.

For more information, please refer to our [Model Integration Guide](https://docs.xtreme1.io/xtreme1-docs/developer-reference/model-integration-guide).&#x20;



### Enhanced the Function of Data Import and Export

#### **Data Import:**

* Support for importing pre-annotation dataset on 3D Dataset

Note: Only importing the class name is supported, attributes and global classification are not yet supported.

### Image Similarity Map Optimization

* The algorithm is optimized.
* Selecting multiple targets in the image similarity map, you can jump to the data tab to find the corresponding images.

### Add Dataset Split

In the data preparation process of model training, the data can be directly divided into sub-datasets of Training, Test, and Validation sets.
