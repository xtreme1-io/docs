# ðŸ’¡ Install with Docker

Xtreme1 can be installed via Docker.&#x20;

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine. It is recommended to use the latest version.

### Prerequisites

#### Operating System Requirements

Any OS can install the Xtreme1 platform with Docker Compose (installing [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on Mac, Windows, and Linux devices). On the Linux server, you can install Docker Engine with [Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

**Hardware Requirements**

| Component  | Recommended configuration                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| CPU        | AMD64 or ARM64                               |
| RAM        | 2GB or higher                                |
| Hard Drive | 10GB+ free disk space (depends on data size) |

**Software Requirements**

For Mac, Windows, and Linux with desktop:

| Software       | Version      |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Docker Desktop | 4.1 or newer |

For Linux server:

| Software              | Version        |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Docker Engine         | 20.10 or newer |
| Docker Compose Plugin | 2.0 or newer   |

:warning: **(Built-in) Models Deployment Requirements**

Two built-in models only can be running on Linux server with [NVIDIA Driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html) and [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker).

| Component | Recommended configuration                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| GPU       | NVIDIA Tesla T4 or other similar NVIDIA GPU |
| GPU RAM   | 6G or higher                                |
| RAM       | 4G or higher                                |

### Download package

Download the latest release package and unzip it.

Or using the following command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/basicai/xtreme1/releases/download/v0.5.2/xtreme1-v0.5.2.zip
unzip -d xtreme1-v0.5.2 xtreme1-v0.5.2.zip
```

### Start all services

Enter into the release package directory, and execute the following command to start all services. It needs a few minutes to initialize database and prepare a test dataset.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Visit [http://localhost:8190](http://localhost:8190) in the browser (Google Chrome is recommended) to try out Xtreme1!

You can replace `localhost` with IP address if you want to access from another machine.

#### Docker Compose advanced commands

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Start in the foreground.
docker compose up

# Or add -d option to run in the background.
docker compose up -d

# When finished, you can start or stop all or specific services.

docker compose start
docker compose stop

# Stop all services and delete all containers, but data volumes will be kept.
docker compose down

# Danger! Delete all volumes. All data in MySQL, Redis and MinIO. 
docker compose down -v
```
{% endcode %}

Docker compose will pull all service images from Docker Hub, including basic services `MySQL`, `Redis`, `MinIO`, and application services `backend`, `frontend`. You can find the username, password, hot binding port to access `MySQL`, `Redis` and `MinIO` in `docker-compose.yml.` For example you can access `MinIO` console at `http://localhost:8194`. We use Docker volume to save data, so you won't lose any data between container recreating.

### Enable model services

> Make sure you have installed [NVIDIA Driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html) and [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker). There is no need to install the CUDA Toolkit, as it is already contained in the model image.

<pre class="language-bash" data-overflow="wrap"><code class="lang-bash"><strong># You need set "default-runtime" as "nvidia" in /etc/docker/daemon.json and restart docker to enable NVIDIA Container Toolkit
</strong>{
  "runtimes": {
    "nvidia": {
      "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
      "runtimeArgs": []
    }
  },
  "default-runtime": "nvidia"
}
</code></pre>
