# Export Data

## **General Definition**

1. Use the `ISO 8601` format of the UTC time zone, such as `2012-03-29T10:05:45Z;`
2. Use the V4 version uniformly where `UUID` is required, such as `6ec0bd7f-11c0-43da-975e-2a8ad9ebae0b;`
3. Name all data types by using `uppercase + underscore`, such as `3D_BOX`;

## **Definition of the Classification**

The Classification contains only one attribute, but attributes can be nested in multiple layers. That is, the Option can also contain attributes.
