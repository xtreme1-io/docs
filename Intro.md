# Introduction


Xtreme1 is the world's first open-source platform for **multisensory training data**.

Xtreme1 provides deep insight into data annotation, data curation, and ontology management to solve 2D image and 3D point cloud dataset ML challenges. 

The built-in AI-assisted tools take your annotation efforts to the next level of efficiency for your **2D/3D Object Detection**, **3D Instance Segmentation**, and **LiDAR-Camera Fusion projects**.


## Getting Started


You can install Xtreme1 on a Linux, Windows, or MacOSX machine.

**[Prerequisites details and built-in models installation is explained here](./Docker-image)**

Get started from the **[Quick Start](./getting-started/Quick-start)**:
```bash
wget https://github.com/basicai/xtreme1/releases/download/v0.5.2/xtreme1-v0.5.2.zip
unzip -d xtreme1-v0.5.2 xtreme1-v0.5.2.zip

docker compose up
```

And Give us a :star: on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/basicai/xtreme1).
