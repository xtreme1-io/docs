If you want to build or extend the functionality, consider downloading the source code using Git and running Xtreme1 locally:

### Enable Docker BuildKit

We are using Docker BuildKit to accelerate the building speed, such as cache Maven and NPM packages between builds. By default BuildKit is not enabled in Docker Desktop, you can enable it as follows. For more details, you can check the official document [Build images with BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build\_enhancements/).

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Set the environment variable to enable BuildKit just for once.
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose up

# Or edit Docker daemon.json to enable BuildKit by default, the content can be something like '{ "features": { "buildkit": true } }'.
vi /etc/docker/daemon.json

# You can clear the builder cache if you encounter some package version related problem.
docker builder prune
```
{% endcode %}

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basicai/xtreme1.git
cd xtreme1
```

### Build images and run services

The docker-compose.yml default will pull application images from Docker Hub, if you want to build images from source code, you can comment on the service's image line and un-comment build line.

```basic
services:
  backend:
    # image: basicai/xtreme1-backend
    build: ./backend
  frontend:
    # image: basicai/xtreme1-frontend
    build: ./frontend
```

Then when you run `docker compose up`, it will first build the `backend` and `frontend` image and start services. Be sure to run `docker compose build` when code changes, as the up command will only build images when it does not exist.

> You should not commit your change to `docker-compose.yml`. To avoid this, you can copy `docker-compose.yml` to a new file `docker-compose.develop.yml`, and modify this file as your development need, as this file is already added into `.gitignore`. And you need to specify this specific file when running `Docker Compose` commands, such as `docker compose -f docker-compose.develop.yml` build.
