**Settings**

* There are many settings in s that can help annotators better identify objects. For example, by displaying the intensity value of points, changing the size of points, etc.

****

**Results**

* Annotated object results will be displayed here. The label can be found through filters.

**Data Info**

* to display the information of the dataset.
