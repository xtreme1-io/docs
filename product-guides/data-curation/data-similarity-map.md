  Data similarity map is a visual representation that shows the degree of
  similarity between data points in a dataset. It allows you to quickly
  understand how closely related or connected different data

# Data Similarity Map

## Find it in `Dataset` -> `Overview`&#x20;

* [A PyTorch implementation of MobileNetV3](https://github.com/xiaolai-sqlai/mobilenetv3) is a convolutional neural network that is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm, and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances.
* [openTSNE](https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE) is a modular Python implementation of t-Distributed Stochasitc Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), a popular dimensionality-reduction algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data sets. openTSNE incorporates the latest improvements to the t-SNE algorithm, including the ability to add new data points to existing embeddings, massive speed improvements, enabling t-SNE to scale to millions of data points and various tricks to improve global alignment of the resulting visualizations.
